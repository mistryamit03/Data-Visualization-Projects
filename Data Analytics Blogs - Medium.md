**1 Menu Optimization, Segmentation, and Clustering using Supervised Machine Learning Model - K-means Clustering**

**Project summary:** 

Blogged about a project focused on customer segmentation using Machine Learning and Classification Model K-Means Clustering. This project was an attempt to optimize the menu of Starbucks coffee to tailor it to health-conscious customers so that the products taste great and develop drinks with less sugar and calorie content. The dataset we are aiming to use in this report is nutritional data focusing on the catalogue of beverages offered at Starbucks along with their nutritional content. 

The K-means clustering algorithm is a simple unsupervised algorithm that’s used for quickly predicting groupings from an unlabelled dataset. Clustering is the mechanism by which a given set of patterns is partitioned or clustered into disjointed clusters, and is so done that patterns of the same cluster are identical and patterns of two different clusters vary. 

**Final Result:**

**Diet1:** Belongs to the Amateur cluster, and if you can see below, there is a list of items which fall in this category, having less than moderate levels of sugar, calories and fat content.

**Diet2:** Belongs to the Beginner Diet cluster along with the beverages which fall in that category.

**Diet3:** Belongs to the Pro Diet cluster along with the beverages which fall in that category.

**Type:** Structured Dataset

**Tools used for Data cleaning:** **Excel, Jupyter Notebook Python**

To determine 

· Who are the most popular artists in the Spotify top 200?

· How do listening habits in terms of popularity differ from country to country?

· Which are the most popular tracks or the most trending tracks?

· Which tracks are streaming most over time?
