### 1. Menu Optimization, Segmentation, and Clustering using Supervised Machine Learning Model - K-means Clustering

**Project Summary:**  
Blogged about a project focused on customer segmentation using Machine Learning and Classification Model K-Means Clustering. This project aimed to optimize the Starbucks coffee menu to tailor it to health-conscious customers by developing drinks with less sugar and calorie content while maintaining great taste. The dataset used contains nutritional data of beverages offered at Starbucks.

The K-means clustering algorithm is a simple unsupervised algorithm used for quickly predicting groupings from an unlabelled dataset. Clustering partitions a given set of patterns into disjointed clusters such that patterns in the same cluster are similar, whereas patterns in different clusters vary.

**Final Result:**  
- **Diet1:** Amateur cluster - includes items with less than moderate levels of sugar, calories, and fat.
- **Diet2:** Beginner Diet cluster - includes beverages that fall in this category.
- **Diet3:** Pro Diet cluster - includes beverages that belong to this category.

**Type:** Structured Dataset  
**Tools used for Data Cleaning:** Excel, Jupyter Notebook, Python
